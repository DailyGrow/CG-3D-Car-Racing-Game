# CG-3D-Car-Racing-Game
AE-86

This is a group project. We exploited 3D Car Racing games, created realistic car models, and built a whole CG world with OpenGL.
We implemented multiple complex functions in game development such as NURBS curve modeling, real-time collision detection when roaming, complex light illumination model, complex material effects, etc.
